I'm a 27-year-old guy born in Italy. I've started with Graphic and Web Design far in 2004 with a lot of passion for the web. Now, after 11 years, I have the same passion but now oriented to the web development and UI crafting.

At the moment, I know Javascript basics but I'm specialized in detailed UI creation, UX and CSS/HTML frameworks infrastructure. I also make sketches, wireframes and prototypes UI.

I know very well markup (and their behaviours) and representation languages like HTML and CSS. I'm oriented in making modular and OOCSS infrastructures and frameworks with the power of LESS preprocessor.
