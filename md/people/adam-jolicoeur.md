Greetings! My name is Adam Jolicoeur and I'm currently an Interaction Designer living in Massachusetts with my wife, 2 dogs and 2 horses. I started my career as a UI Developer, but transitioned over to a full time designer when I realized that I enjoyed designing and utilizing my art background more than I did sitting and coding all day.

When not at my day job, I prefer to read, go kayaking, hang out with my family and play video games (primarily PS4). I also like to design random things for friends.
