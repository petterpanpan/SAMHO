I’m Jan-Christoph, interface & interaction designer currently focusing on ownCloud. Some years ago I wrote my thesis on [Usability in Free Software](http://jancborchardt.net/usability-in-free-software). I’ve been consulting and contributing to various open source projects in the past, and worked with university design students to get them involved in open source.
