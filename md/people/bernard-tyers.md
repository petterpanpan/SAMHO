Hi! I'm Bernard. I am a user researcher and interaction designer. I currently work in UK government researching and designing services for the public which need to be used when interacting with government.

Before this I worked for a number of charities designing apps. Before that I changed careers. Before that I was a telecoms engineer building mobile phone networks.

I firmly believe in the right to privacy, and the availability of end-to-end private communications tools for everybody. One of ways this can happen is the use of open source software.
