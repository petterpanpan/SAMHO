Hello, I'm [Hylke](https://www.twitter.com/hbons). Right now I'm working as a freelance designer. Previously worked on open source projects at Intel and Red Hat and still somewhat contributing to [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org). I started the [SparkleShare](http://www.sparkleshare.org) project to make it easier for designers and developers in open source to work together.
