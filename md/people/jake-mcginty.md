Hi all! I'm Jake, and I'm with [Open Whisper Systems](https://whispersystems.org), mostly working on [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) (a secure messenger for Android). While I'm not a designer by any professional definition, I love it and studied Human-Computer Interaction.

Since joining the open source world in a serious way about a year ago, I've had a lot of fun talking to everybody else that's been in the community for longer about the obvious design gap. Great to see more efforts underway to help remedy that, and excited to be part of it :). Looking forward to meeting everybody at some point or another!
