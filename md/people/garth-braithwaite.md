I'm Garth Braithwaite. I'm a designer and FED living in Idaho. I work at Adobe on the PhoneGap team previous to joining the PhoneGap team I worked on other Adobe Open Source products, including Flex, Brackets, and Topcoat.

A bit ago I spoke at BlendConf on Open Source Design, and shortly after started DesignOpen.org. The primary goal of the project is to improve the standard of design in open source projects but a close secondary goal is to help educate designers of the benefits of open source.

Now we have a few more core contributors working on it including @una and @terracomma. We also have our second group of students from the Facebook Open Academy that are dedicated to working on some new tools and research.
