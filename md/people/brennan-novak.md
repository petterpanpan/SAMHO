My name is Brennan Novak. I am formally trained designer and informally trained
hacker. I'm an internet builder who's most curious about social technology,
sustainable design, and biophilia. I currently work on Transparency Toolkit
and other security related software projects. I'm a co-founded of Mailpile and
work as a UI / UX designer and software engineer. I have an experimental
psychology project called Emoome. I like to contribute to the #IndieWeb as it
is helping the internet redecentralize.
