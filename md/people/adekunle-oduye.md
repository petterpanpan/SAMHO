Adekunle Oduye is a Product Designer at Nasdaq OMX, where he’s part of 30 person team designing web-based products that serve communications, public relations, and investor relations professionals. Adekunle main skill-set includes interaction/user interface design and front-end development….making him the ultimate weapon! Outside of Nasdaq, Adekunle is a co-organizer for [SassConf](http://sassconf.com/) and [GothamSass Meetup](https://github.com/GothamSass), which serves front-end developers, CSS ninjas, UX mavens, and lovers for the best css-preprocessor. When he’s not creating cool software you can probably find him traveling the world or exploring the streets of New York City.
