My name is Roy, I'm an interaction designer based in the Netherlands. [I contribute to Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/u/yoroy). I attended and spoke at the open source design devroom at Fosdem2015.

I'm good at turning ideas into a plan for something that can be built, turning word documents into wireframes. I make abstract art in the form of etchings and monoprints.
