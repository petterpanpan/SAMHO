Hello! I'm Gary, a software and industrial designer in Raleigh, NC. I currently work with a small biotech startup, handling all creative efforts within the company. I'm looking to expand my portfolio to include some different types of projects and audiences.

Please reach out to me with any questions, requests, or comments. I'm really looking forward to working on some awesome projects here.
