Front-end developer evolved from visual arts. Anxiously curious. My objective is to keep alive the link between design and development, between code and art. I follow open source philosophy principles as a way of life.
I am front-end developer at [Kaleidos](http://kaleidos.net/cc0000/) and UI developer at [Taiga](http://taiga.io). In my free time I like to contribute to open source projects and brush my unicorn.
