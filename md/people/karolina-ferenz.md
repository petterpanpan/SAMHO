I am Karolina. I am multidisciplinary designer working and living in London. Over the past 15 years, I worked as print and digital designer (alongise developers) for various comercial projects from global ad campaigns, tv shows to websites, apps and games. Bringing more designer to the open source table is my ultimate goal. Unicorns FTW!
