Hey guys! My name is Ivan. I'm designer currently leading small design department at Intech company in Moscow, Russia. We're making graphics, services, mobile apps and websites for mobile operators from Russia, Baltics and CIS.

I love to design things =)

I'm also in love this digital fabrication (and all kinds of DIY activities actually). All this 3d-printers, CNC's, laser cutters, microcontrollers, robots, drones... =)

I'm enjoying open source movement and hope to meet some cool projects and people here.
