I am a full stack developer of the modern web. I express my apps business values in RSpec, capture it's behaviour in Ruby on Rails models and help Humans to interact with it's data through mobile first, responsive and progressive enhanced HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript driven user interfaces. For more than a decade I am a rigorous practitioner of Free Software development. I love the raw power of communities collaborating and I believe that everyone should be able to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that is running the world.

My day job at SUSE.com is hacking, operating and maintaining the Linux distribution development platform Open Build Service. A massive Ruby on Rails/Perl application. In my free time I practice my skills by developing an event organization app, the Open Source Event Manager, by operating a lot of the server infrastructure of the openSUSE project and by teaching free software development with programs such as Google Summer of Code. When I'm not hacking you'll find me either hiking the world or in the next football stadium.
